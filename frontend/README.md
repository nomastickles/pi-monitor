### How to change the frontend on the pi

Flask frontend is already built and saved within "./backend/static". However if you want to further augment your experience here's the deal:

1.  clone this repo in your remote device (rpi) and get the backend working
2.  clone also to your local machine for actual frontend dev'ing
3.  from local dev `yarn start` and do your thing
4.  once you are happy use `build:copy-files-to-flask` (example:)

```sh
MAGIC_USER=pi MAGIC_HOST=192.168.1.123 yarn build:copy-files-to-flask
```
